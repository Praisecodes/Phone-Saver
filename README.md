# Phone-Saver

This is a really cool project with C++ OOP which any beginner can try he's or her hands on.

What is basically going on is that the program takes input from the user of how many ohone numbers he/she wants to store and then give s the user the opportunity to key in thess
numbers and eventually the user can decide to see these numbers or decide which number he/she wants to see.

This employed the OOP concept on data abstraction which can also be called information hiding by spliting into seperate files (Phone.h and Phone.cpp) this way we were able to decalre methods in one file and define them in another file for example.

#Phone.h
class Phone{
  public:
    void Enter(); //Method in class Phone.
}

#Phone.cpp
#include Phone.h

void Phone::Enter(){
}

Above I showed Declaring a method in one file and Defining in another file.

Hope you enjoy reading this code.
